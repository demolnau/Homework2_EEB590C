## Assignment:
 Select one of the two datasets (HW2.dat1.csv or HW2.dat2.csv found in the Data Repository). Each contains a multivariate dataset and several independent (X) variables. Using the methods learned in weeks 6-10, examine patterns in the dataset. You may use one or more (or all) of the X-variables, and a variety of methods to describe the patterns.

You must use at least one method from the material learned in:
Weeks 6-7, Week 8, Week 9, and Week 10
